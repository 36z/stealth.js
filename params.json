Also you probably won't see the unconfirmed transaction, but this is more an issue in our obelisk interaction or in obelisk.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou can install it using npm:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install stealth.js --save\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd require it as a *node module* or as *AMD*.\r\n\r\n![How Stealth Addresses Work](https://i.imgur.com/rHhNKL6.jpg)\r\n\r\nMore information at [DarkWallet/Stealth](https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealth). \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
